# 0.Introduction.

There is no doubt that giving and helping important causes is one of the most rewarding experiences in life. Charity is the fundamental pillar we use to reach people who need financial help. For the longest time, those more fortunate have given a helping hand to those in need. After all, this is what makes us human and helps us do something positive for the community. Charities today function as the middlemen between donors and recipients. By using a small percentage of the donations, they manage to run organizations that link the two parties with each other. 

We believe that charities should be transparent and honest in all areas of work, and we intend to do this with Vides with the final aim of creating a user-friendly platform that aims to connect the non-profit community through an easy-to-use interface which allows full transparency and traceability of donations. 

# 0.1 Industry research.
## 0.1.1 Background

The non-profit sector today is worth an estimated $2 trillion worldwide, yet headlines in recent times have seen the sector stumble between corruption scandals, gross inefficiencies, false expenses and misuse of funds such as the $187 million misappropriation to cancer charities by James T. Reynolds. Recent high-profile scandals include donors of the Helpers Community Inc. raising concerns regarding the misuse of donations and the Trump Foundation admitting to self-dealing. In other cases, donors are mystified at the lack of results, like in the case of the Red Cross’ failure to enable recovery in Haiti despite receiving $500 million in donations
following the 2010 earthquake.

## 0.1.2 The problem

The public is slowly starting to become aware of the issues that surround charitable organizations. Just a decade ago the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) was found to be using a large number of their donations for personal benefit and the Red Cross was unable to answer where the $500 million for the earthquake’s victims in Haitiwent. Instead of 130.000 houses, the organization only built 6. ​(NYTimes, 2008 & NPR.org, 2015). As years passed, more scandals caught the media’s attention. The unreported donations to the Clinton Foundation, the Trump foundation’s charity for veterans that was used to dispute the president’s legal disputes and, finally, the extravagant lifestyle of charity leaders of multiple organizations that were all paid by the company’s donations. ​(Bloomberg, 2015 &Washington Post, 2016).

## Trust

Trust towards charitable organizations is declining rapidly. It’s only natural given the global awareness of the current issues and the limited transparency. In research conducted by the Guardian in 2016, it was found that trust and confidence in charities have fallen to the lowest recorded level since monitoring began in 2005 – from 67% to 57%. ​(Shawcross, 2016). Similar studies in the US show that 1 in every 3 Americans does not trust charities. ​(Perry, 2015)The problem here and the foundation of this decline over the years is the failure of charities to prompt trust. These non-profit organizations do not see the uncertainty of public trust as something that will affect their business’ financial models. As a result, donations will potentially fall even more making it increasingly difficult to regain trust once it is lost.

## Transparency

Transparency is a major link to trust. By being transparent with their operations, priorities and financial expenses, charities show the public that they are honest and allow donors to engage more actively in the process. While presenting their progress on their own media channels such as websites, blogs, and reports and having the recipients of the donations do the same from their side, these organizations face one major problem. Charities do not have a platform or process to allow donors to track how their finances are spent. Heavily rounded-up numbers and insufficient information on the process are signs of poor transparency and, as a result, a decline in the public’s trust.

Our project aims for sustained development, our objective being to improve people's lives by providing a service that will create a connection between people that need help and people willing to contribute with financial funds. This connection will be formed due to the user interface of the user experience in order to let people enjoy it without discrimination and they will help to create social cohesion between different social classes (people with different financial levels).

# 0.2 Global Charity Trends

To get a better overview of the Charity Market we analyzed the 2017 Global Trends in Giving Report (givingreport.ngo). This is a research project that seeks to gain a better understanding of how donors prefer to give and engage with their favorite causes and charitable organizations. In total, 4,084 donors from 95 countries across 6 continents took part in the research. 

The key results are presented below:

Donor’s interests

The  largest  jumps  in  contributions  were  made  by  the  following  categories:
environment and animal charities, arts, culture, humanities organizations, international affairs nonprofits, and health causes.

Online donations
The trend  is clear:  online
 donations have huge and continuous growth potential. The direction will keep towards online donations, people are switching from traditional payment methods (cash, SMS, bank transfer, etc) to online donation services.
Lack of access to technology
NPOs and NGOs located in developing nations often have limited access – or no access at all – to online and mobile fundraising tools and this lack of access to technology is reflected in the 2017 data. 

# 1. Ethnographic research

#1.1 Segmentation
 
To make the segmentation of the audience, we first categorized donors by age.
The segmentation is presented below: 
25 or under: A person under 25 years old may not have a lot of financial resources, but they might feel passionate about a cause. In that case, organizations could ask them to volunteer or give a small amount, such as $10 a month. The messaging might point out how donations like these cost less than their morning cup of coffee from a neighborhood café.
26 to 35: People in the 26- to a 35-year-old group may have opportunities to become fixtures in their communities as they get involved in clubs or groups and make friends with colleagues or peers. It could be ideal to encourage them to launch personal fundraisers to get people they know involved with the cause.
36 to 46: Many people in this group may have families with kids or grandchildren. In that case, it could be useful to talk about making support for your organization a family tradition that sets a good example for younger people in the household.
46 to 60: Once individuals reach this age group, they may be interested in supporting your organization through events like charity galas or auctions. By that time in life, many people have established connections with influential individuals or become notable in their own right by doing things such as running successful businesses. They could be well-positioned to either donate significant amounts of money to sponsor an event or give things like gift certificates or other goodies to use for a raffle.
60 or older: The people in the 60+ group may be perfect volunteer candidates — especially if retired. Make sure your messaging reflects that. Also, think about how people in this segment may be pondering what to put in their wills. You could mention that a person might state in their will that they want to give a particular amount to your organization, either as a lump sum or an ongoing gesture of support after they pass away.
According to Global Giving Trends report, the majority of donors are based in wealthy countries where fundraising technology has been widely available, used, and trusted for nearly two decades, yet as the digital revolution and economic prosperity spread worldwide, we will begin to see more donors emerge from all corners of the globe. This 2017 data indicates that most donors are women of all ages who lean liberal on the ideological spectrum. 

However, there is a lack of Generation Z born after 1998 and they are considered as digital natives and the future of the global economy. 
Generation Z 
By the end of 2020 this generation will be the largest group of consumers worldwide. In the U.S., Europe and the BRIC states they will make up to 40% of the consumers and 10% in the rest of the world. Even now they are enormously important for the economy and marketers, as already 93% of household purchases are influenced by generation Z, especially services and goods regarding travel, food, household goods, and furniture. 
This generation grew up with diverse family structures, a more varied mix of ethnic groups and blurred gender roles. Before they go shopping, they look for inspiration online, on platforms like Pinterest, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube. Whenever they are shopping in-store, they are getting real-time feedback from their friends via WhatsApp. 
The boom in social media and online communication has enabled Generation Z to form genuine connections and online friendships based upon common interests – regardless of geography. The peer group of Generation Z is a global one; and as you probably already know, peer-to-peer fundraising is one of the most effective ways of raising money for charity.

# 1.2 Vides Traffic (main company)
The next step was to check traffic and web performance with SimilarWeb. Unfortunately there was a lack of sufficient data to get an explicit overview. Even so we managed to obtain important data that helped to create our user profile: only 4. 38% of the traffic source is social. 
After having a closer look at social traffic sources, it turned out that 100% of that traffic comes from Facebook, which means that the young audience is the very target audience. Otherwise, social traffic would come from other social networks, especially from Instagram. For example,  Statista has recently published the rates of popularity of Instagram among ages. The numbers say that 75% of 18–24-year-olds use Instagram.

# Social survey
 
To make a demographic analysis of users we conducted a survey, by sending direct messages to followers on Instagram and on Facebook.
 
Hi, I am  _____, a master student from the University of Bologna. I am doing research on charity. If you don’t mind, could I ask you to answer very short questions? 
 
How old are you? 
What is your occupation? 
How do you know the Organization for Women, Education, Development Vides, how are you involved with them? 
Do you follow them on other social networks? (Twitter, Instagram, YouTube?)
Do you make donations or help with used things, clothes? How often?
 
 
Thank you for taking the time to answer the survey:)

The survey showed that all the responders were involved in charity. All of them answered that they do help non-profit organizations. 8 of the responders make small donations occasionally. 17 Facebook and 3 Instagram users follow Vides on other social networks.

# 1.3 The User Profile 

The analysis of the charity market, its trends and the analysis of social networks of Vides Organisation as well as conducted survey allowed us to create the user profile that highlights the precise target audience.

## Demographics: males, females, born after 1995, 18-25 years old. 

Psycho graphics: check cell phones every few minutes; are active on Instagram, YouTube and other social networks; prefer digital content to any other content type; look for inspiration online; constantly check the phone before going to bed and in the first five minutes of waking up.

## Behaviors: students or part/full-time workers, volunteers in local or global projects, can donate with small things (sandwiches, coffees) or used objects (books, clothes)

# 1.4 Target User Testing
During all our user testing we did not ask for users’ email and name (or other identifiers) since they are considered Personal Information in some locations. 

## 1.4.1 Questionnaire Form 1 (link)

In order to have the picture of what users’ needs and demands are, we have created a generic form with few questions about charity subjects on which answers we think we can develop our strengths. 

The questionnaire was aimed at revealing the following data:

Gender and age, useful to outline users
Level of knowledge about charity
If they make donations, volunteer
What actions are responders most interested in:
Becoming  a Volunteer
Making Donation
Learning more about an organization's history
Where do donors' money go
Getting involved in community
Reading Legal documents
Learning about the Team and the people behind the project
Following Projects’ stories
Watching Photo/video
Choosing a particular project to help(not necessarily financial but any kind of help (used things, books, friendly chat, consulting)
Reading news/blog
Signing up for newsletter
Learning how my little help can make a difference
Questionnaire Form 1 Results

The detailed results can be found here. 

As data concepts and structures differ, we have come across  a misunderstanding during the questionnaire: polysemy. One of our testers misunderstood the word ‘donate’ instead of financial donation, she thought of organ donation; she has said the reason why is her recent studying on organ donations. After we understood that the same word is used by the same actors to describe different things, we put a clear explanation of the form, Vides at the beginning of the form.

The results of the questionnaire helped us to identify needs and demands of the target audiences, their likes and dislikes:

## Generation Z likes:
Photo/Video content
Where do actually money go
Helping projects (not only financial support, also used things)
Generation Z dislikes:
Newsletters
Legal documents and other documentation






## 1.4.2 Interviews
We conducted direct interviews with our target audience. In total we interviewed 15 people.

The aim of the interview was to find out:
percentage of target users who are already involved in volunteering activities, their needs and demands.
what prevents those who are not involved in volunteering, their needs and demands.

The chart below presents the charity activities volunteers take part in: 
2 out of 15 responders do Volunteering,  3 out of 15 responders donate money and 8 donate used things.


We asked those who answered No if they would like to be a volunteer, 14 out of 15 answered positively.

Among the main reasons for not volunteering are:
“I don’t have enough time and volunteer schedules are too inflexible”
“I don’t have enough information and most volunteer roles aren’t interesting”
“No one asked me to”
The main reason for not donating used things was also the lack of information about who needs those used things and where to bring them.
To present the results in a chart we divided the answers according to the lack of:
Time (2 out of 11)
Information (5 out of 11)
Motivation (4 out of 11)


Potential for increasing volunteerism is high if we are able to address these barriers. By overcoming them, we can create a new social norm of volunteering throughout one’s life. Lack of motivation is likely to result from lack of information as a cause-effect relationship.
The concept of lack of time is very subjective. Most likely, it is related to the traditional idea that volunteering takes a lot of time and requires a donation in the form of unpaid hours. As a result, this reason can be attributed to lack of information as a cause-effect relationship as well because people are unaware of projects that need quick help.

Hence, the problem of access to the information appears to be a crucial one. Since Generation Z are all digital natives it is necessary to adopt to their needs, facilitate access to charity projects and increase its awareness in digital medium. 

To strengthen our hypothesis “Target audience lack relevant authentic digital content to be aware of how they can help and make a difference” we asked the responders some relevant questions. 
The results are presented in the charts below, only 1 out of 15 responders follow charity on social media:

All the responders answered that they would share a post about a charity project on their social profiles to raise the awareness to the problem.

Generation Z are the new wave of social media users. They are far more switched on when it comes to what’s going on around them, but they’re also noted as having shorter attention span when it comes to engaging with a piece of content. So, keeping things brief, relevant and authentic will have the biggest impact. For example, visually, video content that’s designed to empower and motivate is best when it comes to inspiring Generation Z.


 
# 2. Assessment of existing resources (competitor)
Giving to charity online through crowdfunding donations has been a resounding success, with dozens of giving sites scattered across the web. Because they help all types of donors to quickly and conveniently find worthy causes to support. 
Crowdfunding sites bring together many charities in one place, so a potential donor does not have to hop around looking for individual charities. That is why these platforms have features that facilitate user-experience by providing easy filtering, commenting and sharing functions. These sites provide widgets that they can put on their homepages, and make it easier to raise funds.
Besides accepting donations for charities, many online giving sites invite individuals to set up personalized fundraising campaigns for their favorite causes or even to help other people. In turn, charities can run their peer-to-peer fundraising campaigns through these sites.
Kickstarter is one of the biggest names when it comes to crowdfunding, an American platform known for helping tech and creative entrepreneurs fund their projects before getting a loan or raising money for venture capital. 
This site performs a variety of tasks such as helping nonprofits set up year-round fundraising, providing a home for group fundraising, and guiding individuals to worthy causes. This is an amazing hub to start your journey towards experience the joy of helping people.
Kickstarter is a website that helps artists, musicians, designers, filmmakers and other creators find resources, support and bring creative projects to life. Their target users are funders and project’ creators who need fundraising to meet their goals.
It’s also easy to use on the fundraising side—begin by setting your goal and then a time period to complete it. FYI: before your campaign can launch, you'll have to be approved by Kickstarter. For each level of money raised per individual, you set a small gift or personal experience for your donor.
Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform, which means that you don’t get your funds unless you complete your campaign. It also means that the funder’s credit card won’t be charged unless you meet your campaign goal. The fee is 5% on top of processing payment charges (3- to 5-percent) per transaction. If you raise enough money, there’s a 14-day waiting period for funds. 
Kickstarter creates a clear header that depicts the type of campaign and what the user wants to do. Each page has a similar layout where it shows the genre title on top and various trendy/featured campaign below. The consistency is also clear where each section is divided with a simple grey line which is subtle!


# 2.1 The Main Organization: Kickstarter

The top navigation bar allows users  to ‘Explore’, where the user is led to view details about Kickstarter’s collections, sections and categories; and ‘Start a project’, which allows users to start their own campaign in one of the categories. On the top right of the bar, there is a search box that is possible to browse projects by collections, sections, categories and ‘On our Radar’; and ‘log in’ in which there is an option to sign in via e-mail or sign up via Facebook. The navigation bar features  project’s categories which can be also reached by clicking on ‘Explore’.

## 2.1.2 First Inspection of the Competitor’s System (Kickstarter)
Project’s page

The user is welcomed to click on each project’s page which presents an easy-navigated project’s pitch that contain story, risk and challenges and some other sections, customized by project, photo/video content and is supported by such categories as FAQ, Updates, Comments, Community. Under the content part, there is a section with icons labeled with a project’s categories and location. Clicking on location allows to browse other projects with similar location. The interface also shows the project’s goal as well as the amount of collected funds.

Once the page is scrolled down, the users see the option to subscribe, detailed information about the projects, reports, podcasts and stories. The last but not least is the footer which the users are shown the social media buttons, about KickStarter, their privacy policy, language, and currency option.

For a better understanding of the website, we have written the steps that the user encounters during the donation: 1) Select a project; 2) Have a look at the frequently asked question in case it is necessary; 3) Check news about the project if any; 4) Check data regarding those who supported a project; 5) Select the option to donate; 6) Choose the currency and pledge amount; 7) Either log in or continue as a guest by presenting the email address; 8) Enter card information; 9) share a project on social media.

## 2.1.3 Direct Analysis 

This part describes the systematic exploration of the Kickstarter platform with respect to the Accessibility guideline.

Accessibility concerns the possibility for a generic user — independently of his/her personal abilities — to easily and naturally access the website and its contents. The sub-characteristics of accessibility are derived from those defined by W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). However, in this context they do not specifically refer to possible user disabilities, but we assume a wider point of view where accessibility is understood as a necessary property for all users, without any exception.
 The sub-characteristics of accessibility belong to the perceptual ("perceivability"), cognitive ("understandability") and pragmatic ("operability") spheres of an individual that reduces the mental load needed to maintain context and consistency in the dialogue(in short-term memory) and limits use of raw access to memory(in long-term memory). 
 
 
The severity of a usability problem was considered as a combination of three factors:
The frequency with which the problem occurs: Is it common or rare?
The impact of the problem if it occurs: Will it be easy or difficult for the users to overcome?
The persistence of the problem: Is it a one-time problem that users can overcome once they know about it or will users repeatedly be bothered by the problem?
Finally, we accessed the  market impact of the problem since certain usability problems can have a devastating effect on the popularity of a product, even if they are "objectively" quite easy to overcome.
The following 0 to 4 rating was used to rate the severity of usability problems:
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released
 
 
Main page:

## 1 Even though the overall design is laconic and is not overloaded with information, the font used throughout the whole page is rather small. According to  Usability.gov 11:8 for users over age 65, it may be better to use at least fourteen-point fonts. 



## 2 Overall, the website has more text links than image ones, but some links make use of generic names such as “Click here’,  ‘Read more’ with no surrounding text explaining link purpose. It is very important to let the user know what they are going to be learning when they click. For example, screen reader users use text around links to help understand what the link does. If the link text is very general, and there's no surrounding text, there's no way to work out what the link does. In this case it is recommended to use a descriptive link label (which helps all users) or add an aria-label to the link (which helps screen reader users). 

## 3* In order to find ‘Help Center’ in case a user needs assistance on the website, some scrolling till the end of the page is required. According to Guideline 2.4 Navigable: ‘Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.’ Hence, it would be more comfortable for user experience if there was an easy widget with Help Assistant or an online chat.


## 4* According to Usability.gov 17:4, a search option should be provided on all pages where it may be useful - users should not have to return to the homepage to conduct a search. What is more, the search option does not suggest ‘recent searches’ to ease the user’s cognitive load.


## 2.1.4 Reverse analysis


## 1. As for Learnability issues, it is worth mentioning that some pages have the same title. According to WCAG 2.0 A F25 Section 508 (2017) A F25 it is important to use different names so the title cannot be used to distinguish pages. 

→ ' Kickstarter ' is also used on https://www.kickstarter.com/ , https://www.kickstarter.com/?ref=nav

## 2. Some users may find it hard to read light gray text on a white background, dark gray text on a black background and white text on a red background. As indicated in WCAG 2.0 AA 1.4.3 Section 508 (2017) AA 1.4.3, text and background colors should have enough contrast.


# 2.2 Discount Usability Test
## 2.2.1 Definition of Testing Protocol

To implement a user testing we opted for Discount Usability Test, also known as Guerilla Usability Testing.  Like other usability techniques, guerrilla usability testing is a way to evaluate how effective an interface is by testing out its visual design, functionality and general message on its intended audience and capturing their responses. Guerrilla testing is a fast method that provides sufficient insights enough to make informed strategic design decisions.

In order to design the test we opted for the following characteristics:

Type of test → formative (suggestion for improving the application).
Test scope → horizontal (few functionalities for all relevant tasks and all type of users affected)
Logistics:
settings → empty classroom, tester with their own laptop, the manager takes notes during the test.
assistants → none, only one manager
participants → people born after 1998, 7 participants
Methodology → thinking aloud



To get a quick baseline measures of Kickstarter product user experience we set the following tasks:

Register on the website with Facebook.
Browse projects by categories.
Choose Public Benefit in ‘On our radar section’ 
Filter projects by popularity.
Donate a project using the card information.
Reach Kickstarter Blog.
Subscribe to Kickstarter Games projects.
Find help assistant.
Rate on a 7-point scale the ease of user experience (7 - the best)

The testing methodology was Thinking Aloud. We asked test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud — that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface. 

We asked participants to tell:
what are they thinking
what are they trying to do
how do they think they should proceed
what doubts are coming to him
what they read and how this relates to the task.

We collected usability metrics in the three Es: effectiveness, efficiency and emotion.
Effectiveness
 The accuracy and completeness with which users achieve specified goals.
Efficiency
 The accuracy and completeness of goals achieved in relation to resources.
Emotion
 Freedom from discomfort, and positive attitudes towards the use of the system.


## 2.2.2 Analysis of subject and objective data

This section describes the generated data:

Register on the website with Facebook.
Done pretty fast. Nothing to say.

Browse projects by categories.
Even if the task seems tricky, browsing by categories was not difficult for the digital natives who are our target audience. Kickstarter’s goal is to let people support and donate creative projects; so browsing is important, the way the categories are designed are found accurate enough. 

Choose Public Benefit in ‘On our radar section’ .
The task may seem tricky at first glance. Our motivation for the task was to calculate how the testers will behave to a task complex enough like this. Despite the task’s trickness, the users have claimed like ‘Ah, it must be here(‘Explore’ section)’ or ‘On our radar! What kind of phrase is that?’ . However; the testers have been able to perform the task around 1 minute.

Filter projects by popularity.
This task has been found very difficult to proceed. The testers spent almost 2 minute on finding the filters for popularity even if filtering is widely used in websites by the users. The task can be performed successfully in 2 different ways: Either from ‘Explore’ section, explore categories and then the user will be able to see the filters or clicking on a category on the main page and then click on explore the category where the tester will perform the task. The accessibility of the filters should have been enhanced.

Donate a project using the card information.
As we have donated for each user to conduct our analysis, we have wanted to test it among the users. The testers were fast moving. One of the steps of this task may require also the first task which is to continue with Facebook instead of signing up. Inserting the card information was found very easy as online payments are widely used.

Reach Kickstarter Blog.
The testers have not found the task difficult. They have made complaints only about the font size of the text ‘Kickstarter Blog’ being very small and hard to recognize. 

Subscribe to Kickstarter Games projects.
This task was very simple as the testers have only been supposed to scroll down a bit and seen the ‘Subscribe’ box.

Find help assistant.
For the task one needs to know the right section in advance, otherwise the information can only be found by scrolling to the footer.

Rate on a 7-point scale the ease of user experience (7 - the best)
Even though all the participants liked the platform and had a pleasant user experience, 4 of the participants complained about  a small gray font of the website, which made it more difficult  to comprehend the content.
# 2.3 The Main Website - Vides
# 2.3.1 Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design
Inspection of the system was made by following the guideline of heuristic evaluation usability method, introduced by Jakob Nielsen which detects usability problems within a website and helps in creating educated changes to site improvement. It is a valuable technique in the sense that it gives a quick feedback and it is extremely cost effective.
Visibility of System Status
 


- Text links usually download faster, are preferred by users, and should change colors after being selected. It is usually easier to convey a link's destination in text, rather than with the use of an image. Users often find it hard to tell which images are clickable without moving the cursor over them ('minesweeping'). Another benefit to using text links is that users with text-only and deactivated graphical browsers can see the navigation options.


- An active 'Home' link on the home page makes some users think that it's not the home page.

- Link uses general text like 'Read More' with no surrounding text explaining link purpose.
Screen reader users use text around links to help understand what the link does. If the link text is very general, and there's no surrounding text, there's no way to work out what the link does. Either use a descriptive link label (which helps all users) or add an aria-label to the link (which helps screen reader users). 


## User Control and Freedom:
It is one of the most basic heuristics for interaction design to support user control and freedom by allowing users an "emergency exit" out of any situation they may have entered.  The private area has an explicit way to Cancel  the current window by providing an extra feeling of safety 

There should be always an option to cancel the monthly donation, save and/or cancel the card and/or insert new card details.


- Some pages have 9, 11 font sizes. It is recommended to use at least a 12-point font on all web pages. For users over age 65, it may be better to use at least fourteen-point fonts. 

- Use of unclear terms
 
Unclear terms in names of web sections such as: 5Х1000, the organs. This may force users to make extra actions by clicking on those sections to understand the meaning and  if they could be of any interest to a user: 5Х1000 is the share of tax on personal income (0,05%)  that the taxpayer, according to principles of fiscal subsidiarity, can allocate to non-profit entities. The term is likely to be unfamiliar to 50 % of the users.


-The system does not provide for error prevention since search section does not suggest corrections in the event of making a spelling mistake.
 

 
## Recognition rather than recall
The website makes use action buttons and objects which help to minimize user's memory load. However, the system lacks "recently viewed" section that would allow to keep the recently viewed projects in the home screen and that will remind the user about her/his last views. 
Flexibility and efficiency of use
 
One of the ways through which efficiency for users can be enhanced is to give them easy access to functionality that they need the most.
Back to top button is effectively used as UX guidelines recommends that the back to top buttons should be small and at the lower right side of the page whose position is out of the way, but noticeable.
 

The website in question provides the list of recently searched terms.
 

- Text cannot be searched
Google Bing
Some text is presented in graphics form only hence it cannot be searched. 



- No touch icon on mobile version
 
It is recommended to create a touch icon so the website will make a good impression as a bookmark on mobile devices.


 
## Aesthetic and minimalist design

 
The overall colour scheme is light and welcoming. It also incorporates red color into the scheme as a call to action.  Since red is the most expressive color, It represents intense emotions such as passion, aggression, love, emergency etc. What is more, a few groups have done case studies on whether red buttons generate better click rates than green ones. As it turns out, those studies showed that red did increase the click rates in most cases. 
The banner image shows a direct example of how the organization is helping people, and also encourages the visitor to donate with a red call-to-action button.
The navigation bar section is explicitly expressed. Next to "Dona Ora" button there’re contact details (email, number), the possibility to switch languages, a Search, social networks buttons and Private Area.


- The navigation bar section is overloaded with sections. For instance, the HOME section works the same as a clickable logo with the functionality of one route home. Also, there are 8 other sections (Home, Chi Siamo, Cosa Facciamo, Sul Territorio, Come Sostenerci, Gallery, News, Contacts) which could be possibly regrouped to provide a better information architecture. One of the possible solution to implement the regrouping is by analysing results of card sorts which we incorporated for further redesign. 

The description is too long.  An ideal, meaningful description should contain 140-180 characters.
 
 
## Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
Despite the issue related to the absence of suggested corrections described in Error Prevention section above, it is noteworthy that the system, when a user is accessing the private area shows that there is no such a user found or the password is wrong.
 

## Help and documentation

The users can relate a help animation/image on the top on the screen with a real payment card and fill up the details without any confusion even if they are not familiar with net banking. 
 

- There is no documentation that is focused on the user's tasks and list concrete steps to be carried out. 


- There isn't any online assistant chat that would speed up and easier the communication.
 

#3. Feasibility Study
Our feasibility study was aimed at making the analysis that takes all of a project's relevant factors into account by uncovering the strengths and weaknesses of the project in question.
We will provide a description of the product and the service, details of the operations and management, marketing research and policies.

We incorporated a design approach CAO=S in our feasibility study, CAO=S is a simplified implementation of a goal-oriented model. It is based on the study of the information types (Concepts) that the application must manipulate on behalf of the user types (Actors) by providing commands (Operations).

Our feasibility study is the initial stage of our design and also a base for the usability tests, because we will find out what are the main difficulties and where the major problems may be.
3.1 The Actors
The actors are the categories of users that act on the application interfaces to perform their tasks by manipulating the data structures (which they interpret as concepts). 
We focused on Direct Actors, who will personally use the system. The direct actors were  divided into categories based on the type of role they must have within the application and therefore the type of interfaces to be created.

The indirect Actors can be the investors, Vides’ workers.
# 3.1.1 Personas

# Persona 1 - Francesco

Francesco who is 20 year-old studies Foreign Languages and Literatures at the University of Bologna. He is from Puglia, senior-student at the faculty of Economics. As he is about to finish his lessons, he wants to fill his free time. 
He is competent with today’s technology as much as his adolescent. He uses Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. Francesco lives with his friends in a shared apartment; he lives in Via Massarenti and pays 450 Euro per month for a single room. He is granted for the scholarship and he sometimes works as dog walker at the weekends. As he is a senior-student who focuses on his thesis which will be about contemporary Russian poetry.
Compared to his small town(Altamura) in Puglia, he feels like he is going to have good opportunities in Bologna where he has connections, friends. Since he is finishing his lessons and has more free time now, he wants to focus on his thesis. He has never participated in a voluntary project abroad and he has never donated in his life except for non-financial ones. So, he wants to sustain a kid at a distance by giving from his scholarship so that everyone can study.
In particular, we did an analysis of our target users identifying their fundamental characteristics, six basic features of our target user with a clear impact on the implementation of the system: 
## 1.Technical competence (ability to manage the complexity of today's technology with different devices)
→ Francesco is competent with managing technology.
## 2.Domain competence (the knowledge of practices, terminology, subtleties on the subject of the system)

→ Francesco knows about charity organizations.

## 3.Language competence (knowledge of the language of the system and the ability to understand subtleties, irony, etc)

→  Francesco speaks Italian and he lives in Italy; however, he does not expect irony or sarcasm in this kind of context. 

## 4.Physical Ability (the set of physical limitations that reduce the ability to use the device)
→ Francesco does not have any physical limitation.

## 5.Motivation (the set of motivations that cause the user to be interested in a task, to use a system for the task, to use THIS system for it.)
→ Francesco is strongly motivated and he knows what he is looking for as he is very interested in bearing the educational costs of an African kid. 

## 6.Concentration (the presence of environmental distraction and the ability or possibility, to provide adequate focus on the task)
→ Francesco needs a particular focus on the task and he knows it would take time; however, he knows it is not too stressful to be fully concentrated. (For example; he can easily donate because he can save his card information in his Vides’ account; however, it requires attention even for the first time unless he uses Apple Pay.)

In order to have a visual and simple approach to this system, each persona is associated with a C & A diagram. Francesco occupies the area within the area of the created polygon:
 

# Persona 2 - Lucia

Lucia is a teenager who is 18 years old living in Milano with her parents. She is about to finish high school and thinking of which university to study and the study field, she is very interested in Philosophy. Recently, she has seen an Instagram post of a friend of hers, Leonardo, who is participating in charity projects voluntarily. Lucia clicks Vides’ website via Leo’s Instagram story. While Lucia reads about  Vides’ activities, she thinks of kids who are bit younger, who live without parents, she wants to help them but as she does not have enough money to support them (La quota è di 312€ l'anno (26 € mensili), e può essere versata mensilmente, trimestralmente, semestralmente o annualmente tramite) but she sees the option of sharing books with kids which has sounded an amazing idea for her. She thinks that maybe the world is diverse but the kids have in common and she has thought of books that moved her feelings, basically enlightened her. As she likes Philosophy, Sophie’s World by Jostein Gaarder will be one of the books she is going to send.
In order to proceed with ‘Sharing books with kids’, she has chosen Malawi as location. Later on, she takes the screenshot of the address and goes to the post office after packing her favorite books to share with her bookworm friends at distance.
As we have done Francesco’s analysis of identifying his fundamental characteristics to see the impact of the system, here is Lucia’s fundamental characteristics:
## 1.Technical competence (ability to manage the complexity of today's technology with different devices)
→ Lucia is competent with managing technology as she is a digital native. However; her technical competence is related with managing social media, surfing on the internet; not some computational skills.

## 2.Domain competence (the knowledge of practices, terminology, subtleties on the subject of the system)

→ Lucia is only 18 years old, she does not have a good knowledge of charity funds, their terminology but she knows about donations, the process of involving in a project.

## 3.Language competence (knowledge of the language of the system and the ability to understand subtleties, irony, etc)

→  Lucia speaks Italian and he lives in Italy; however, she does not expect irony or sarcasm in this kind of context as Francesco has not.

## 4.Physical Ability (the set of physical limitations that reduce the ability to use the device)
→ Lucia does not have any physical limitation.

## 5.Motivation (the set of motivations that cause the user to be interested in a task, to use a system for the task, to use THIS system for it.)
→ Lucia at the beginning has not given full attention to the task as it was an Instagram story of her friend. She got more motivated and involved with the task later on when she saw the option of sharing books.

## 6.Concentration (the presence of environmental distraction and the ability or possibility, to provide adequate focus on the task)
→ Lucia did not have to give any specific attention to this task because she took advantage of technology by taking the screenshot of the destination address. 

Lucia occupies the area within the area of the created polygon:

# 3.2 Concepts
Concepts are the way in which users perceive the organization of information managed by the application. Our system will allow the user to register on a platform to be a part of a community,  follow projects, share their stories and help projects according to the preferable form of donation.

We tried to extract the main concepts which define the main information that our system should focus on providing:

## Account
Since our target users are digital natives, who prefer to spend less time on doing certain actions and access information rapidly, it was necessary to make them possible to Sign Up and Log in the account with their Social Network. 

## Personalized Search
 In order to fulfill the requirements of users with different levels of Motivation, they will be able to choose projects by categories and types of donations.

The application will allow users to filter the projects to reduce the cognitive load and facilitate faster access to the information. The filtering can be done by considering location, the most urgent projects and the most popular ones. 

Projects
The project page is the heart of the platform. It's where people can share their needs and backers go to see how they can support projects.

Our goal was to define how big the stats should be, how prominent the pitch video should be, what elements deserved to be higher on the page, how many columns the page should have, how comments, backers, and updates should relate to the project page.

How can users fast and easily find and extract information about the project?
Large content (Photos/Videos). The content part will have a big space on a mobile screen to attract attention.
Short description of the project will be added on the main page, other pages and on the project’s page itself  (under the pitch video/photo part) as it's the quickest way to get a sense of what the project's about in the creator's own words.
Location and category will be added as tag labels by clicking which users will be redirected to other projects of the same tag category or location.
Statistics regarding the collected funds will be added, as well as the desired financial goal of the project.

## Comments
Our target audience are completely comfortable posting replies and leaving comments, so it was important to let users have a possibility to let others know what they think.

## Likes
## Shares
Likes and shares are essential attributes of the Generation Z so, it was of paramount importance to let users like and share content.

## Donations
At this point we incorporated the same logic with users with Different Motivation as for Projects, but we went deeper, having in-mind the fact that Gen Z has grown up in the hyper-personalized world of targeted advertisements and social platforms. This generation is multitasking so, it was our key goal to let them personalize each step of the journey and increase its speed by filtering projects’ categories by types of donations and in case of financial donation, types of payments.

# 3.3 Operations
The operations are operations on the concepts, not on the data structures. They are tasks interesting for the actors on the concept.

The operations according to CAO = S are of four types:
Creation
View
Update
Remove

We prioritised some user’s needs to manipulate the concepts easier and complete their tasks:

## What users need to create Profile easily?
## Common simple create operation
Humans are getting lazier by the day with the appearance of all those hyper-convenient apps. Hence, users need to access the account with the most widespread social profile IDs (Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, Linkedin). 

## Rare simple view operation
Traditional Sign Up with the need to insert your data would be a rare operation for digital natives. However, to value ethics over user convenience a conventional sign up has to be provided as well.  To improve user experience, we suggest some ideas:
Cap locks On
Password hints

We do not want our users to be perplexed and frustrated due to the multiple “incorrect password” error messages, only to find out that my caps lock was on or by continuous attempts to create a password. By presenting users with an immediate validation that their caps lock is on and specifying that password must be at least 6 characters long,  it saves time and prevents negative emotions.

## What users need to personalize their search?
## Common simple view
The search will suggest users options according to his latest search. It will facilitate New users experience on the application.

## Common simple view operation
Users will be able to filter project’s categories:

Volunteering - projects that need contributions of volunteer projects.
In-kind donations - projects that require transfer of funds.
In-kind gifts - projects that need contributions of different kinds of goods.
Sponsorship - financial support of a kid on a regular basis.

## Common simple view operation
In-kind gifts were divided in sub categories, to name them we chose a series of common terms that seem to satisfy all types of goods and be familiar to Less and More expert users:
Clothes
Books
Electronics
Food
Sports and Hobby
Kids
Others

## Common simple view operation
To identify most relevant filters for projects  we considered key characteristics that may help to filter the projects to a specific user.

Location - projects filtered according to the distance to the user location.
Popularity - projects filtered according to the number of shares and likes.
Urgency - project filtered by how urgently a project needs help.


## What users need to customise their experience?
Common simple view
Location and browsing history.
The application will recommend projects near the user as well as remind users of recently viewed projects.

What stats users need to have to make a decision about what project support?

The user needs to have at hand such information as: 

Common simple views
Campaign (Project’s pitch and story)
FAQ (Frequently asked questions)
Updates (recent project’s updates)
Comments
Community (the data where the backers come from, how many of them)

What users need to  make a financial donation?
Common simple views

As for online payment donations, we thought it would be important to let users make fast donations, without the need to insert their credit card details each time they want to donate. To overcome those little difficulties we suggested incorporating payment with a fingerprint as well as to connect a debit or credit card to the Account as a preferable means of payment.

# 3.4 Scenarios  
During a lunch break at Scuderia, Francesco had a conversation with his colleagues over non governmental organizations including volunteer associations and Sara mentioned one of them: Vides(International Volunteering Women Education Development) and she continued that basically the organization is implementing activities and projects based on the prevention of youth hardship, the support and recovery of young people in difficulty, immigrant literacy etc and via Vides for those who need, you can both make donations online and/or be voluntarily part of their existing projects. 

Francesco came forward and said he has been looking for these kinds of associations and be part of it to help those especially children and women who are in need, want to get an education. Moreover; he complains about a small number of associations which are accepting volunteers for this specific task, most of them are only accepting donations. On the other hand Francesco is willing to donate, too and as he is a student, he thinks helping someone else study is also a good reason. After he comes back home, he visits the website of Vides. Firstly, he looks through the homepage, read about Vides’ legal and financial documentation, their goals, their activities. Later on, he reads about ‘Sustain a kid at distance’ in the ‘Get Involved’ section and continued with the process. And lastly he takes a look at the Instagram stories of the volunteer participants with African kids and he is super amazed by them.

 
 
Lucia has been thinking of sharing her books with African children. On a Instagram story of her friend about helping African children with English in Nepal and she feels super enthusiastic about it and she feels so proud of her. 

She goes in Vides’ website. She cannot be a part of voluntary projects as she does not have time but she wants to share her books. So, she goes on the section of ‘Share books with kids’, chooses the location and saves the address to be sent. But she could not distinguish red and green color. She goes in her account to active the Color Blind Mode. Afterwards, she receives a message from the African reader saying thanks and he has liked the book very much.

 
 

Joseph is a 23-year-old student from San-Francisco, he lives in Bologna. He feels passionate about making positive effect on the world. 



On Sunday evening he shares a charity project from Africa on Facebook. He wants his friends to know that our little help can make a difference:
 "Let's help children together! You won't be poorer by donating 5 EUR, but it means a lot to Africa"



Joseph's friend Mattia sees the post and decides to support the charity project with 5 EUR, he shares the project on Instagram.



Mattia's friend Francesca sees the post, she can't donate with money, but she would like to donate with books. She starts browsing projects and supports Jane from Egypt.






Jane receives books and her teacher lets Francesca know how happy she is.
"Thank you, Francesca, the books have arrived, everything is okay! Jane is very happy"


Mattia checks the delivery status of his 5 EUR donation, he is glad to see that now the charity project needs less money to achieve its 500 EUR goal to buy a computer in the classroom. 
















# 4. Design Proposal
# 4.1 Information Architecture

The goal of our design proposal is to let the users retrieve information in an efficient way by leaving them focusing only on their goals.
Firstly, we have decided on the structure of information retrieval by being based on the data retrieved from the users.
A step contains a set of operations that a user can do within the website. 
The sitemap describes the steps a user can take.

We designed the first scratch with a top-down approach by which we have specified the top-level categories and break each category into smaller pieces that have the lowest level of information. Architecture representation is done by an outline which is a traditional text representation and easy to construct and modify. 


Our redesigned mobile version of Vides’s website has all necessary pieces like home, about/introduction, contact, search. The site is relatively broad; as recommended there are no more than 3 hierarchical levels, we grouped the related options. Each category has comprehensive coverage and all topics are in the correct category(e.g. ‘Blog’ and ‘Social Media’ in ‘Follow Us’). 
One of the aspects that we have given attention to is the navigation bar through which we try to make the hierarchy clear so that the user can understand which options are the top level vs sublevel and review all options without scrolling over the options. Moreover; the search task includes some search tips; for example, if there is a mistyping of a text(Bologna - Balogna), the system will suggest ‘Do you mean this?’; that can be seen as a  search aid component. Suggesting alternative searches increases search performance. When a query does not return a result, suggested alternative queries will appear but in the case of the projects filtered by location, the approximation of the results will be done.

# 4.2 Interaction Design Approach 

While designing for the users, we have tried to answer these questions:
What can the user do with their finger?
The physical interaction in our case is done through swiping on a smartphone. As clicking on symbols is easier; the navbar, search and the icon(which leads to the homepage) are stuck in the current page.
Do error messages provide a way for the user to correct the problem?
One of the search aid components, suggesting alternative searches is tended to be clear and simply understandable because the information should only communicate the necessary information to the user which also should not overwhelm.
What feedback does a user get once an action is performed?
The typical feedback that a user can get in our case is the confirmation message through the system that they have successfully completed that task once a user donates. A unique feedback design idea of ours is to send the photos of the assisted children and/or a postcard, letter from those kids to the donor to enhance the emotional bonds between the users and our design.
What clues does the appearance give to the user about its functionality?
In order to create digital message, we have decided the colors, the size of the images and layout; moreover, we have added the Vides’ icon for the user to interact with(when it is clicked, the user will be led to homepage. Our design tries to build emotion that motivates people to convert and ultimately donate.

# 4.3 The Structured Blueprint


 
The structured blueprint represents the architecture to illustrate our ideas. ‘Home’ is positioned at the top so that it can be easily identified and different hierarchical levels are marked with different colors.
 
# 4.4 The Wireframes
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QzEEUsaupOHi2Q_G7_Yhbp1E715_XmM5Nc3qQqaEUys/edit#slide=id.g6edc49f8f3_0_55

# 5. Evaluation of Design
Once we had the prototype, we needed to evaluate it. First of all, we needed to test it by ourselves and solve possible problems. Once the system satisfied us, we started doing tests with possible users. 

# 5.1 Inspection
The design team is composed of Lisa Siurina and Simay Güzel and the inspection took place within the design team. In order to discover the problems within the website, we used three techniques which are the cognitive walkthrough, the action analysis and the heuristic analysis. Our motivation to use these techniques was to analyse more accurately if the intended interaction is easy and took place without problems.

## Cognitive walkthrough and Informal action analysis

The tasks evaluated were the same we wanted to test with users:

Register on the website with Facebook.
Browse projects by categories.
Share books with African children.
Filter projects by popularity.
Donate a project by using Apple Pay.
Add a new card to your account.
Sustain a kid at a distance.
Activate color blind mode.

We have executed the tasks step by step by trying to feel like in the shoes of the users when they perform the actions for the first time. We have tried to perform the similar actions as much as possible by relying on the general knowledge and following the suggestions of the system. However; it was rather difficult to perform the actions pretending like we did not know the system and what we are looking for within the design.

Besides, we made quantitative analysis by keeping the recording of the time that had been spent on the website within the time of each step. The time spent is important because it can be measured to gauge serendipity. Also within the concept of time, while using the system, encouraging the users their progress (e.g. Sustaining a kid at distance) track, and/or resume their interaction (the confirmation of online banking activity)? This kind of approach has also led us to discover the reason of excessive complexity and and loss of time or disorientation to measure the effectiveness of the system.

Lisa and Simay completed the tasks mentioned below:

0. Explore the main page (Thinking aloud)
The main page has a continuity with the homepage. The general aspect of the mobile version of the website and the navbar which has accurate elements make a good impression.

1. Register on the website with Facebook
For both Lisa and Simay, this task which was to click on the Facebook login button and the page will ask if the user wants to authorize his/her Facebook account with Vides; it  was very simple to carry. The time spent on the task is affected by the internet speed.

It took 11.65 seconds for Lisa and 13.32 for Simay to complete the task.

2. Browse projects by categories

The categories in which the projects are grouped are found very accurate by the design team.

It took 10.10 seconds for Lisa and 10.68 for Simay to complete the task.


3. Share books with African children 

Both Lisa and Simay directly clicked on ‘Get Involved’ as they have said that the sections are divided accurately and clearly; so choosing the section in the navbar for this task is carried out successfully and in a short while. Later on, the design team has chosen quickly one of the locations to send their books.

 It took 25.20 seconds for Lisa and 26.67 seconds for Simay to complete this task. 


4.Filter projects by popularity.

Lisa completed the task by clicking on ‘Explore’ and then chose a category and filtered the projects in Italy by popularity. Simay, on the other hand, has chosen a category from the navbar and proceeded with the task

It took 17.41 seconds for Simay and 16.69 seconds for Lisa to complete this task. 

5. Donate a project by using Apple Pay.

As online banking is widely used, completing the task was not complex for the design team. Since donation options are clearly understandable, both Lisa and Simay inserted the card information easily, received the billing information and saved the card information for future donation.

It took 15.62 seconds for Lisa and 16.20 seconds for Simay to complete this task. 

6. Add a new card to your account.

Even if this task required more attention for correct selection of the section, both Lisa and Simay found ‘Our team’ section in footer and uploaded their CV successfully.

It took 1:48,81 seconds for Simay and 1:40:54 seconds for Lisa to complete this task.

7. Sustain a kid at a distance.
As there are two possible ways to complete this task, the design team proceeded the task differently. Simay reached the goal by following the section ‘Get Involved’ in the navbar and then clicked on ‘Share Love’ and then chose to bear the costs of an African child via saved cart (the card information is saved via the 5th task). On the other hand, Lisa completed the task by first scrolling down the main page, clicked the option of sustaining a child at distance in the projects box and continued as Simay did.

It took 16.70 seconds for Lisa and 15.20 seconds for Simay to complete this task.

8. Activate color blind mode.

Both Lisa and Simay have guessed to start by clicking on the navbar icon to find the settings and proceed with the task.

It took 10.05 seconds for Lisa and 11.68 seconds for Simay to complete this task.

At the end, we have discovered that all is okay unless little mistakes due to the very last updated version of Vides’ website.

# Heuristic Analysis

The design is compared with a list of predefined design principles to analyse if the system has been following the rules of thumb, best practices, standards and rules which are based on some sets of common-sense rules derived from past experiences and general, universally recognized principles.


1 - Visibility of system status
How does our system always keep the user informed about what is happening? 
The user can always see where he/she is; they can look at each link and see where it goes. Additionally, as text links are more easily recognized as clickable, the users can easily see the navigation option and find the corresponding text links to download some documents related with sustaining a kid at distance, financial reports of the organization.
In the ‘Recommended For You’ section, the user has the option to horizontally scroll the projects.

2 - Match between system and real world
How does our system speak the user's language?
Our system now contains surrounding text explaining the link (Read More) purpose, in our case when a user scrolls down the home page he/she will see the different option of getting involved in the organization. There, each ‘Read More’ option(share book, share love, share coffee) contains a descriptive text. 
The indication of a project’s current situation increases the involvement of the user with the system; it increases the user’s motivation to participate, donate. 
Moreover, the user can send feedback related with his/her thoughts and has the option not to share his/her data without his/her consent.  

3 - User control and freedom
How does our system support undo and redo?
Our system now allows users an "emergency exit" out of any situation they may have entered. The users always have an option to cancel the monthly donation, save and/or cancel the card and/or insert new card details.
There is always a backspace icon on the left top corner of every page so that the user can easily go back to the previous page.

4 - Consistency and standards
How does our system support consistency and guarantee that the same words, situations, or actions have coherence everywhere?
As recommended, 12-point font is used on all web pages. Unclear terms like 5Х1000, the organs and their purposes are explained clearly.

5 - Error prevention
How does our system prevent the user’s errors?
If a user makes a spelling mistake, the system recommends for correction. Filling the form to sign up takes time for the user and if there is a problem with the password’s syntax and the user has to refill the form, the user may lose his/her motivation, enthusiasm with the system. For this reason, a recommended syntax of a password(e.g. the password must contain a number, a capital letter) is added if a user wants to sign up.

6 - Recognition rather than recall
How does our system minimize the user's memory load?
As card information can be saved in our system for the future usage, the user's memory load is minimized. Moreover, the system contains a "recently viewed" section that would allow to keep the recently viewed projects in the home screen and that will remind the user about her/his last views. 
User’s options to continue with social media accounts(Facebook and Twitter) to create an account saves energy, motivation and time. As inserting the email and the password every time is exhausting, a little box to put a checkmark on with a text description(Remember Me) is added. Moreover, the user can personalize his/her account by creating a page which contains his/her favorite projects and communicate with other people through messaging. 
 

7 - Flexibility and efficiency of use
How does our system speed up the interaction for the expert user?
The touch icon makes a good impression as a bookmark on mobile devices. And there is a like button(heart) and a share button at the right bottom corner of each project so that the user can share his/her feelings inside the platform.
For faster interaction with the system, we have placed a navbar icon on the top right corner of every page.

8 - Aesthetics and minimalist design
How does our system avoid irrelevant or rarely needed information?
Our system does not have an overloaded navbar. The regrouping of sections makes browsing easier on the website.The descriptions are also shortened(140-180 characters). Additionally, we have a color blind mode, it is regarded as a type of assistant technology, screen magnifier. We have found it an important feature to add in our design as According to Colour Blind Awareness 4.5% of the population are color-blind. Like this, we are also improving the ergonomic aspect of our design.


9 - Help users recognize, diagnose and recover from errors
How does our system express error messages?
The search suggestion feature contains texts like ‘Do you mean this?’ in the case of misspelling of a word.

10 - Help and documentation
How does our system  provide help and documentation?
Our system has online assistant chat that would speed up and make the communication easier.

5.2 User Testing 
We tested our system with the help of 6 volunteers. We decided to perform the same test that we did for the competitor’s website.The testing methodology was again Thinking Aloud so we asked the testers to verbalize their thoughts as they move through the user interface. At the end,  we asked other testers to explore the design proposed and to compile the System Usability Scale.

The tasks to test our design are:

1. Register on the website with Facebook
2. Browse projects by categories
3. Share books with African children 
4. Filter projects by popularity.
5. Donate a project using the card information and save the card information.
6. Find job vacancies.
7. Sustain a kid at a distance.
8. Activate color blind mode.

For each test we used the time spent to complete the task as metric, and we were able to plot the resulting line chart:



We have found few design errors in our system which are related to the physical characteristics of interaction and the controls that allow it: use of colors: one tester has claimed to have suffered from the high density of red color so he could not distinguish the red and green color. For this reason we have added ‘Color blind mode’.
Another error in our design was not to show the projects around the filtered location. We got complaints especially by the users who did not see any results. With the new design, the user can search for the projects in Rimini but if there is not any, the projects in Bologna may be shown. In the case of many results, the infinite scroll will be used. Additionally, the search button is not only placed in the homepage but it is placed in each page.

At the end, with the last design solution (i.e. iteration 8) we asked to other 6 testers to perform the tasks. In order to evaluate the usability, after the tasks, we asked them to answer the System Usability Scale. The results are the following:



Average SUS score is 68 while our design has 83.08 score. Our final design can be said that it is good as the iterations helped us to detect and fix errors so that we can increase efficiency.
.

6.0 Final recommendations

What has been achieved 

We are glad to have reached our final goal. We have redesigned Vides’ website which provides services which are identified to be needed by the users (Generation Z). The users can easily now learn more about participating in voluntary projects, donating; our system also is beneficial for another purpose: Helping poor children both financially and emotionally. The world will be a better place!

What other activities we could improve in the future

Since technology is evolving all the time and changes quickly, the future design is to be adopted and redesigned according to the future demands and needs of the users. To keep a modern presence, a website should be revised every 2-3 years to stay fresh and relevant and to improve conversions and provide a better user experience.
